HF paper code that acquire data from impedance (AD5933) sensor,Heart Rate (MAX303105) sensor, ECG (AD8232) sensor and Accelerometer (ADXL362) sensor using AD5933.h, MAX30105.h, heartRate, and ADXL362.h libraries.
Arduino MKR 1010 (UNO can also be used) has been used as a micro-contoller and its TX1 and RX1 pins have been used for sending data over the bluetooth Serial Terminal using HC-05 bluetooth module.
